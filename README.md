As a solution to this problem statement, you are supposed to create an Angular
application with following views -
1) All regions view - A beautiful looking view displaying all the regions in the
world(you may use free images/icon available on web). On clicking one of the
regions, All Countries view should open
2) All countries view - This should display all the countries of the selected
region. There should be option to go back to previous view as well. This view
should should display countries in format of bootstrap cards with country flags
(image link available with api) as the image of the card and should display only
the important details of that particular country like Name, Capital, timezone,
Currency, Subregions etc. (you may choose to include more details as long as
the view doesnâ€™t become too big). On clicking on a particular country in country
view, a detailed view of that country should open.
3) Single Country view - This view should use the flag of the country as cover
image and display all the information about the countries in different and well
differentiated sections of the page.
4) Currency Filter - On clicking on currency name in any of the above view, all
countries view should open again but this time with a currency filter applied. I.e
it will display that currency filter has been applied, show the selected currency
and will should the country list which have the same currency(irrespective of the
region)
5) Language Filter - On clicking a particular language in any of the above views,
All countries view should open again, but this time with a language filter applied.
I.e it will display the countries which have the selected language (irrespective of
the region).
